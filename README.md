**How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?**

Interpreting user needs and translating them into a program requires a deep understanding of the users' goals, challenges, and expectations. This  begins with gathering requirements through interviews, surveys, and observations. Once the needs are identified, creating "user stories" helps in breaking down these requirements into manageable and actionable pieces. A user story is a simple description of a feature from the perspective of the end user. By focusing on user stories, developers can prioritize features that deliver the most value, make sure clarity in what needs to be built, and maintain a user-centered approach throughout the development process. This helps in aligning the final product with user expectations and improving overall user satisfaction.

**How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**

My approach to developing programs is iterative and incremental, focusing on continuous improvement and flexibility. I plan to incorporate Agile processes such as Scrum into my future development work. Agile methodologies focus on collaboration, adaptability, and feedback. Key practices include maintaining a product backlog, conducting regular sprint planning, daily stand-ups, sprint reviews, and retrospectives. These processes enable the team to respond to changes quickly, improve transparency, and make sure development aligns with user needs and business goals. By using Agile, I hope to enhance efficiency, create a collaborative environment, and deliver software that meets or exceeds user expectations.

**What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**

Being a good team member in software development involves effective communication, collaboration, and a willingness to help others. It means actively participating in team meetings, sharing knowledge, and providing constructive feedback. A good team member is reliable, meets deadlines, and contributes to the overall success of the project. They're open to new ideas and ready to adapt to changes. They also support their teammates, creating a positive and inclusive work environment.
